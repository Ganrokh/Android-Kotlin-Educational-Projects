# Android-Kotlin-Educational-Projects
Projects showing understanding of Android development with Kotlin.
I have a big interested in Android development. I chose to pursue it just after Kotlin support was announced. Kotlin seems to be the future of Android.
Unfortunately, I couldn't study long due to my life getting very busy soon after I started studying it.
As such, there are only a few projects here, and they only show basic understanding of Kotlin.
